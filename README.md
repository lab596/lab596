### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a high school student, I spend a lot of my time being successful with advanced classes and also in sports. In my free time, I work on projects to learn and improve my familiarity with programming languages and applications. 
As someone who likes to give back to the community of Folsom, I also have experience working in jobs that contribute to make this area a better place.
